                        I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of
                        denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I
                        will give you a complete account of the system, and
                        expound the actual teachings.

                        On the other hand, we denounce with righteous
                        indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
                        demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so
                        blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and
                        trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs
                        to those who fail in their duty through weakness of
                        will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from
                        toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy
                        to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice
                        is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able
                        to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be
                        welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain
                        circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
                        obligations{" "}
